When the customer press 3  it should display Categories first.  After it display categories then display items next.  If customer keep pressing 6.next, then display the next 5 items until customer selects one or press 8.show picture.
If no categories, then just display only items


___________ Re-design

Since categories of items would be difficult and slow to work with in sms for elderly.  I need to change it to a flat design.   
Items 1-99    are Lunch & Dinner 
items 100-199 are Beverages
items 200-299 are Deserts
items 300-399 are Others

When customer text the twilio number, the following menu will appear automatically. Return customer will text O to start ordering but new customer will text D to download detail menu and return to order.  THis is a flat menu system and will be the least amount of texting to get items ordered.
